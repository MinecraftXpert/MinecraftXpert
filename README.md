Hello everyone! My name is Noah and I'm an aspiring programmer. 

My goal is to either become a web developer or a game developer. Unfortantley, I am still a noob and am still trying to get the hang of github, but I'm hoping to use this as a way of showing off my talents and projects.

- I'm currently learning JavaScript and C and am hoping to learn C# to learn how to make games.
- I currently know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a little bit of the follwoing: Python, C, and C++.
- Prounouns: Sheep/Sheeps :)
